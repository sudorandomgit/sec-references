# üìò What is Networking?

## üß† Concept

Networking = any time two or more **things** are connected.  
Not just tied together by a rope ‚Äî but connected in a way they can **exchange information**.

This can apply to anything, but in this context, the "things" are **devices**, not humans (or rather not just humans).  
Even though we say "computer networks," it's not just computers ‚Äîit‚Äôs printers, routers, security cameras, Alexas, refrigerators, bulbs, it can be any device.

### ü§ù Key Idea:
> A network allows **connected devices to share and exchange data.**

## üåê What is the Internet?

The internet is basically a **network of networks**.  
It connects many smaller networks‚Äîhome, office, data centers, universities‚Äîinto one massive, chaotic global structure.

**Tim Berners-Lee**, invented the **World Wide Web** (which ‚â† the internet).  
That‚Äôs the *application layer*, not the infrastructure.

I'm assuming protocols like **ARP** and **TCP/IP** existed first, making device-to-device communication possible before scaling up to a big blob.

### ü§ù Key Idea:
> **WWW** is not the internet.

## ‚ùìOpen Questions to Revisit:
- Who holds all the routing info for the internet?  
- How do protocols like ARP actually scale?  
- What are the different *kinds* of networks:
  - Home networks
  - Office networks
  - Large enterprise networks
- How do **websites** live on the internet?
- What makes **search engines** work under the hood?
- Where is all information stored? (Big, but relevant)

## üü° Status:
- [ ] I understand the basics of what a network is  
- [x] I understand the internet as a scaled-up network of networks  
- [ ] Still fuzzy on the infrastructure behind web access and search

- network types - PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN
- devices - Router, switch, hub, modem, access point
- protocols - ARP, IP, TCP/UDP, ICMP
