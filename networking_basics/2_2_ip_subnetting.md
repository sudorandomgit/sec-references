# ðŸ§© Subnetting

## What I Know
Subnetting lets you split larger networks into smaller groups using a **subnet mask**.

## Working Concept
A subnet mask works like a filter that determines which portion of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host. This allows network segmentation, control, and better traffic management.

## Questions to Explore
- How exactly does the subnet mask filter bits from the IP?
- What do common subnet masks look like and what do they mean? (e.g., /24 vs /16)
- How do subnetting and CIDR relate?
